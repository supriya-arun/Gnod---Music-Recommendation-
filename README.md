# Gnod---Music-Recommendation-

# Project Description
In this project of the Data Analytics Bootcamp, I have worked in a real Business case where we will be asked to create a song recommendator based in the user's song preferences, updating the current recommendator of the Company Gnod, based on preferences.

Moreover, we will be asked to show the proposition to the company CEO in a recorded presentation.

To achieve this, I will navigate into the web scraping techniques and the use of the Spotify API, in order to get a huge song database we will use afterwards.

Finally, I will use some basic techniques of Machine Learning as clustering to provide accurate recommendations based on the user's song.
