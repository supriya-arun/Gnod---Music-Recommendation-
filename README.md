# Gnod---Music-Recommendation-


This project, part of a Data Analytics Bootcamp, aims to develop a song recommender system for Gnod, a company specializing in music recommendations. The recommender will be designed to update and improve Gnod's current recommendation engine by tailoring music suggestions based on individual user song preferences. This project includes data collection, machine learning, and visualization components, culminating in a recorded presentation of the final proposal to Gnod's CEO.

## Project Description

In this project, I am working on a real-world business case to create a song recommender system based on users' song preferences. The goal is to enhance Gnod's current music recommendation engine by improving its accuracy and personalization through advanced data collection and machine learning techniques. The final model will be presented in a recorded demonstration for Gnod's CEO.

Key tasks include:

- **Data Collection**: Utilizing web scraping and the Spotify API to build a large, diverse song database.
- **Recommendation Model Development**: Applying machine learning techniques, such as clustering, to generate recommendations based on user preferences.
- **Presentation**: Recording a presentation of the recommendation system for the company CEO.

## Features

- **Personalized Music Recommendations**: Suggest songs tailored to user tastes.
- **Improved Recommendation Engine**: Use clustering techniques to enhance recommendation accuracy.
- **Recorded Presentation**: Deliver a polished project overview and system demo for the CEO.

## Data Collection

This project uses two main data collection methods:

1. **Web Scraping**: To gather song and artist data from multiple sources to enhance the diversity of recommendations.
2. **Spotify API**: To retrieve metadata for each song, including genre, popularity, and related artists, making recommendations more accurate.

## Machine Learning

We apply basic machine learning techniques, focusing on **clustering algorithms** to group songs with similar attributes. By clustering songs based on features like tempo, genre, and energy level, the recommendation engine can suggest songs that align closely with the user's past preferences.
